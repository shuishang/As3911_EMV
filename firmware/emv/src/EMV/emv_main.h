 *
 * \brief EMV Layer 4 data transmission and example implementation of an EMV
 * contactless terminal main loop.
 *
 * This module contains the EMV layer 4 stack, an exmaple implementation
 * of the EMV terminal main loop, and some examples for EMV terminal
 * applications.
 *
 * \section emvMain_sec1 EMV Layer 4
 *
 * The layer 4 implementation of the EMV stack consists of only two functions.
 *
 * One function to init the layer 4: emvInitLayer4(). This must be used after
 * successfull activation of a PICC to initialize the ISO14443-4 half duplex
 * protocol stack.
 *
 * And, one function to communicate with a card on layer 4 (in the context
 * of APDUs): emvTransceiveApdu(). This function deals with all the timeout,
 * error handling, and retransmission requirements of the EMV contactless
 * communication protocol and thus provides a transparent way to transmit
 * an APDU to the RFID card and receive any RPDU send by the card in response.
 *
 * \section emvMain_sec2 Example EMV Terminal Application Main Loop
 *
 * The example terminal application main loop is intended as a blue print which
 * shows how different parts of the EMV software stack should be used together
 * to implement an EMV standard compliant terminal application.
 *
 * The function emvStartTerminalApplication() will start an EMV terminal
 * main loop as defined in the EMV standard. This main loop pools for cards
 * until a card can be successfully activated and then transfers control
 * to the specified application callback to perform the payment application.
 * After the application callback returns a card removal is executed. Once
 * the RFID card has been removed from the field the terminal main loop
 * starts over again and polls for a new card.
 *
 * This exapmle terminal main loop continues to run until a call (from
 * another thread) is made to emvStopTerminalApplication(). The emv layer
 * does not check for terminal application stop requests while an RFID data
 * transmission is in progress. Therefore it can take up to 5 seconds until
 * a stop requests leads to the termination of the terminal main loop (about
 * 5 seconds is the maximum allowed timeout for a single block transmission
 * on layer 4).
 *
 * \section emvMain_sec3 Example Terminal Application Callbacks
 *
 * Two example application callbacks for the terminal application main loop
 * are provided. The prevalidation test application
 * emvPrevalidationApplication() and the digital test application
 * emvDigitalApplication(). These two implement the application logic specified
 * in the requirements for the prevaliation test and digital test of the
 * EMV L1 certification.
 *
 * \section emvMain_sec4 Implementation Overview of the Terminal Application Main Loop
 *
 * The polling loop of the terminal application main loop is implemented in
 * emvPoll(). A call to this function blocks until a card is found or a
 * stop of the terminal application main loop is requested.
 *
 * If the presence of a card is indicated by the return value of emvPoll(),
 * then emvCollisionDetection() is used to perform an EMV compliant collision
 * detection for both type A and type B cards. After successfull collision
 * detection the ::EmvPicc_t paramter of emvCollisionDetection() references the
 * singulated PICC.
 *
 * This ::EmvPicc_t value can then be used to activate (emvActivate()) and
 * initialize (emvInitLayer4()) the layer 4 protocol, perform data transmission
 * (emvTransceiveApdu()), and finally to check for the correct removal of the
 * card form the field (emvRemove()).
