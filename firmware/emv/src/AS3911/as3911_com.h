 * \ingroup as3911
 *
 * \brief This part of the AS9311 module abstracts Communication with an
 * ISO14443-A or ISO14443-B card including features required for EMV.
 *
 * This part of the AS3911 module consists of functions to configure
 * paramters of the datatarnsmission to and from an RFID card and functions to
 * actually perfrom the transmissions.
 *
 * \section sec_as3911RfidCom_1 Receiver Deadtime
 *
 * After the data transmission from the reader is completed the receivers will
 * be kept disbabled until the receiver dead time has expired. This dead time
 * ensures that the receiver does not pick up noise still present from the
 * transmit operation.
 *
 * For EMV the standard specifies that the PCD must ignore any load modulation
 * produced by the PICC for a certain time immediately after the completion of
 * the PCD message. The receveiver dead time can be used to implement this EMV
 * deaf time.
 *
 * \section sec_as3911RfidCom_2 Frame Delay Time
 *
 * The frame delay time is a forced delay between the end of the last message
 * received from a card and the beginning of the next message send by the PCD.
 *
 * If a frame delay time greater than zero is configured then as3911Transmit()
 * and as3911Transceive() make sure that this frame delay time is kept. If
 * necessary they will wait with starting the data transmission until the set
 * frame delay time has passed.
 *
 * If no card response was received after the last message transmitted by the
 * PCD (as3911Receive() or as3911Transceive() returned with a timeout error),
 * then no frame delay time will be applied to the next data transmission.
 *
 * \section sec_as3911RfidCom_3 Receive Timeout
 *
 * The receive timeout specifies the time the AS3911 will wait for a card
 * response after it has completed the transmission of the reader message. After
 * the
 * receive timeout expires the receiver will be disabled internally and no
 * further card responses can be received. If a receive timeout occures while
 * a reception is in progress, then this reception continues until the message
 * from the card has been completely received. So the receive timeout specifies
 * a timeout for the start of the response from the RFID card.
 *
 * If as3911Transceive is used then the receive timeout can be specified as a
 * paramter to the functino call. If as3911Transmit() and as3911Receive() are
 * used seperately then the receive timeout must be set via
 * as3911SetReceiveTimeout() prior to the call to as3911Transmit().
 *
 * The currently active receive timeout is used until a new receive timeout is
 * set.
 *
 * \section sec_as3911RfidCom_4 Error Handling
 *
 * To support EMV special error handling capabilities are build into the AS3911
 * RFID communication code.
 * 
 * If EMV error handling is disabled, then no special
 * error handling takes place and any reception errors are reported via the
 * return values of as3911Transmit() and as3911Transceive() respectively.
 *
 * If EMV error handling is enabled then a second parameter defines the details
 * of the error handling namely the transmission error threshold. If a
 * transmission error (parity error, crc error, error, data encoding
 * error, or frame timing error)occures during reception of a frame whose overall
 * length is less than or equal to the tranmsission error threshold, then this
 * received frame is ignored and the receiver is reenabled to receive another
 * card response. Also when EMV error handling is enabled then any frame with
 * residual bits will be ignored no matter how long that frame was.
 *
 * This is handled transparent to the caller. I.e. the caller will not be
 * informed that an errornous frame has been ignored. Instead he will either
 * get a timeout error reported if no further frame follows the ingored frame,
 * or he will be informed about the content and error status of any frame
 * received subsequent to the ignored one.
 *
 * The transmission error threshold is compared against the
 * received message length as reported by the AS3911. This length may
 * or may not include the CRC bytes depending on the selected CRC processing
 * mode (see usage of ::AS3911RequestFlags_t in as3911Transceive()).
 *
 * \section sec_as3911RfidCom_5 Modulation Depth Adjustment
 *
 * The AS3911 RFID communication module can adjust the modulation depth for
 * the PCD to PICC communication basedon the
 * the measured RF amplitude (on the RFI pins) or on the phase difference
 * between the RFO and RFI pins. Both of these parameters depend on the coupling
 * between the PCD and PICC antennas. So this provides a method to adjust the
 * modulation depth based on the strength of the coupling between the PCD and
 * PICC.
 * 
 * To adjust the modulation depth, the selected parameter is measured and then
 * a table lookup is performed to derive the apropriate RF modulation on driver
 * level. This lookup table defines a piece wise linear function. I.e. if the
 * measured paramter value is not found in the table then a linear interpolation
 * between the two closest values is performed. If the measured parameter value
 * is out of the table range (either lower than the smallest x table value or
 * higher than the highest x table value), then the RF on modulation driver
 * level associated with the lowest or highest table entry is used.
 *
 * The modulation depth adjustment mode and the lookup table can be configured
 * via
 * as3911SetModulationLevelMode(). An adjustment of the modulation depth can be
 * performed at any time by a call to as3911AdjustModulationLevel(). This
 * adjustment is done  automatically when as3911Transmit() or
 * as3911Transceive() is called.
 *
 * \section sec_as3911RfidCom_6 Data Transmission and Reception
 *
 * Data can be transceived either by using as3911Transmit() and as3911Receive()
 * directly as a two step process or by calling as3911Transceive(). The later
 * of which will
 * perform the complete transmit and receive opertion and also allows to
 * specify some additional options not available when using as3911Transmit() and
 * as3911Receive() separately.
 *
 * If the two step approach is used then care must be taken that as3911Receive()
 * is called in time not to loose any data received from the PICC. Also the user
 * must then take care that any necessary interupts are
 * enabled. The necessary interrupts are ::AS3911_IRQ_MASK_TXE and
 * ::AS3911_IRQ_MASK_WL for as3911Transmit(), and ::AS3911_IRQ_MASK_RXS,
 * ::AS3911_IRQ_MASK_RXE, and ::AS3911_IRQ_MASK_WL for data reception with
 * as3911Receive(). Additionally error interrupts should be enabled as needed.
