How to debug an application when using the Makefile:
----------------------------------------------------

1. Define in the Makefile the variable DEBUG_INFO. E.g. by writing the following line:
   DEBUG=1 

2. clear and recompile, by calling:
   make clean all

3. Start the Debugger by calling the Windows Program:
   MPLAB IDE
   that is part of the Microchip Tool chain. 

4. Select from the Menu "Debugger" "Select Tool" "MPLAB ICD 3"

5. Select from the Menu "File" "Import" and select the "*.cof" file from the "build" directory.
   The "build" directory is the directory you specified in the Makefile for the variable
   BUILD_DIR. The cof File will have the name $(BUILD_DIR)\$(TARGET).cof

6. Select from the Menu "Debugger" "Program"

7. Open the source file in that you want to set a breakpoint (by using Menu "File" "Open").
   Go to the desired line in the sourcefile and set your breakpoint using the context-menu.
   Or place a breakpoint through the Menu "Debugger" "Breakpoints".

8. Start the debugger through Menu "Debugger" "Run" (or type F9).

Important issue:
---------------

The debugger always uses memory adress 0x800 till 0x850 for internal purposes. So make sure that
this region is available for the debugger. Set __DATA_BASE in the *.gld file to 0x800!!!
No matter what region you allocate the __DATA_BASE the debugger will use 0x800.
